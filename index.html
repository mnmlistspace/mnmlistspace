          As a graphic designer in this digital era, I am forcing to use Microsoft Windows or macOS. A considerable part of my clients and almost all of my colleagues I work with expect me to use Adobe Creative Cloud. These requirements sometimes have their technical reasons, and sometimes they are just stupid twists. For this reason, I use my windows workstation only when I have to deal with Adobe products. For everything else, I grant in GNU/Linux and, more specifically, in Slackware Linux.

          I have been using Slackware for everyday desktop tasks since 2002. Over the years, I have tried all the significant Linux distributions and some not-so-significant ones. I always go back to the good old Slackware. In my eyes and mind, he offers everything I need and works perfectly. For me, the combination of Thinkpad laptop and Slackware Linux is the greatest thing that can happen to a minimalist person in the IT industry.
