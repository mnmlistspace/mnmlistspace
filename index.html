      <section>
        <p>Nowadays, an entire industry is concentrated on increasing resource usage to show you a few letters on your screen or smartphone. Hundreds of thousands of jobs are based on inefficiently outputting HTML. Ask any newborn dev the first task you do when creating a website. The short answer will be something along the lines of install nodeJS and some sort of package manager. There are thousands of files you probably don't need in your project before you've written one line of code. The theory for web development these days is to start with everything in your site and remove it back rather than start with an empty directory and add just what is essential.</p>
        <p>The modern web is getting laggy and visually overwhelming. Endless popups, nosy notifications, and countless advertisements. Browsing the current web is a painfully stupid experience. It takes too much time, too much effort, and requires too much computing power.</p>
        <p>When browsing this 1000-word Covid-19 analysis - about one page of text long - our web browser loads the equivalent of 73 pages of code. This is more than half a million characters. To be precise: an analysis of 1072 words (6588 characters) requires 613,411 characters of code. Put it differently, the human-readable text of this Covid-19 analysis weighs less than one percent of the underlying source code that loads the content. You will ask: All of that piece of code is used to display plain text or maybe has a different application? The rest of the source code consists of links (more than 724) and all types of scripts related to trackers, advertising objects, and God knows what else. This webpage is the perfect example of why corporate software development does not work. We can learn from the above metrics that the new generation of webmasters moves more towards richer content, more visuals, interactive content, and more tracking systems. </p>
        <p>A website with the primary purpose of delivering content should have nothing more than required to obtain a proper reading environment.</p>
        <p>Void our site of all its distractions, cruft, promotions, advertising, social sharing, analytics, and all you have is the pure reading experience.</p>
        <p>Here's what's necessary for a pure and comprehensive reading experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A lightweight site that's loads fast</li>
          <li>Content-focused design</li>
          <li>Clean and intuitive navigation</li>
          <li>Good-sized and readable font</li>
          <li>A column width optimal for reading</li>
          <li>Moderated amount of whitespace</li>
          <li>Proper contrast ratio</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's everything that a minimalist website should move out of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ads</li>
          <li>Cookies</li>
          <li>Tracking</li>
          <li>Sharing buttons</li>
          <li>Social widgets</li>
          <li>Baaaannneeeers</li>
          <li>Tags, read more links, related posts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why should one pursue a minimalist coming?</p>
        <p>Bloggers and content creators become so hooked up in some stupid trends that they lose the sense of importance: creating helpful content and creating a good experience for the reader. The person visiting your website is not a customer, is not a consumer of ads, or a buyer of your affiliate links. Do not use the visitors of your website as clients. He's just somebody who only wants some information from what you've done. That person just wants to read your thoughts and experience.</p>
        <p>When you create a good reading experience for the reader, he or she will highly appreciate it. The reader will like your content, and then and only then will you choose whether to bookmark it, share it, etc</p>
        <p>All the extra stuff is distracting. Perhaps it'll help you reach your goals as a content creator or blogger. Still, it doesn't benefit the visitor to achieve her personal aims. If you set the distractions in to reach your goals, what is message are you addressing? That your goals are more valuable than those of the person who has genially agreed to visit your website, right?</p>
        <p>But what about the subscriptions, the shares, and the monetization?</p>
        <p>Earning money from your own website is a great idea. I am a firm believer in making a living doing what you love, but let's face the truth. Does it make you happy to force your readers to look at crappy ads so you can make a few bucks? I used to do it in my early days as a blogger, and it grated on me because I personally hate advertisements. You can make money as a content creator or blogger without ads, without being a shitty marketer. Just build an audience by being valuable and trustworthy, then help them with tutorials, howtos, a service, or whatever you can create that benefits them. Making money by helping people? Now that feels good.</p>
